# ToodeBOT

This bot keeps checking if it's in a specified group and if that's true, it sends a inspirational message and leaves the group
As a test it also sends you a message "Hi, me!"

To use this, please install the fb chat API
```pip install fbchat```
For more information about the installation
https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html

In the code you must change the "user" and "pass" section and put in your facebook username and password

Depending on what group you want to keep leaving you should find the group/thread id from the URL from messenger.com, when you have the group chat opened
